### `<pdx-scroll-spy>`

Highlight the section you’re viewing.

⚠️ **`target` is not optional in an app with `pdx-app-layout`.** Same trap as `pdx-affix`: the
default scroll root is the window, and in that shell the window never scrolls — `pdx-app-layout` is
`overflow: hidden`, `main.pdx-app-main` is `overflow-y: auto`. Without `target=".pdx-app-main"` no
section is ever marked active.

```html
<pdx-scroll-spy target=".pdx-app-main" link-selector="[data-spy-link]">…</pdx-scroll-spy>
```

A link's `href="#id"` works as the target selector as well as `data-spy-target`, which the prop
table does not say: `updateLinks()` reads `href` first and falls back to `data-spy-target`.

#### Examples

_From the component's demo, one per section. They illustrate the markup and the calls: `...` marks
code left out, and a script is the part that matters, not a whole file. The props and events they use
are checked against the manifest above._

**Live Demo** — Scroll the content below. The nav links highlight automatically.

```html
<pdx-scroll-spy>
  <nav>
    <a data-spy-link data-spy-target="intro">Intro</a>
    <a data-spy-link data-spy-target="usage">Usage</a>
  </nav>
  <div data-section="intro" id="intro">...</div>
  <div data-section="usage" id="usage">...</div>
</pdx-scroll-spy>
```
